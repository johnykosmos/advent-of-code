# Advent of Code
Repository for adventofcode.org solutions.

## 2024
The main goal I set for 2024 AoC was to get comfortable with the GOlang so that's the language I'm writing my solutions in.
The time I am writing this README and I am solving all these problems day by day I'm a total newcommer to GO, therefore one should
not expect this repository to contain masterclass solutions.
